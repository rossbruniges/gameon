            <h2 class="whimper">Determination of Winners</h2>
            <p>After the Contest Period has ended, all Entries will be reviewed for compliance with the Contest citeria, and then qualifying Entries will be judged by a panel of qualified judges made up of industry experts and young judges from the Hive Learning Network (the "Judges"), who will select the winners. There will be one winner and one runner up in each of the three categories listed below, and the category winner with the highest overall score will be the Grand Prize winner. The categories from which winners will be selected are: Hackable, Learning, and Multi-Device. Entrants select the category in which they want their Entry judged at the time of submission. Within each category, Entries will be judged on the following equally weighted criteria:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Fun — do we enjoy playing this game?</li>
                <li>Technological achievement – how well does this game demonstrate technical mastery in open web technologies?</li>
                <li>Aesthetics – how good is the visual design and interaction experience?</li>
                <li>Originality – have we seen this before? How does the game take advantage of the web?</li>
            </ol>
            <p>Each Entry will be judged by at least three Judges. Judges will not be allowed to review or rank entries from people they know personally. The Judges will give each Entry a score of 1 to 5 for each of the criteria, and the scores of all the Judges that review a particular Entry will be averaged to arrive at the final score for that Entry. The Entry with the highest score in each category will be the category winner. The Entry with the next highest score in the category will be the runner up. The Entry with the highest score overall will be the Grand Prize winner. In the event of a tie, a subset of Judges will review the tied Entries and choose the winner. The decisions of the Judges are final on all matters relating to the Contest and no correspondence will be entered into.  The winners will be announced on or about the 4th of March 2013.</p>
